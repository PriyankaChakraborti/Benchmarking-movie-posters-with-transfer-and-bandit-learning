# Final project-CSE896
Here is our final project for the CSE 896 graduate Deep Learning Course.
# Project goals
Visual discovery is a key element in social media as we speak today especially in any commercial image that is aimed at evoking a real response . With independent movies being churned out especially for streaming platforms like Netflix some posters are specifically being created for social media platforms. The challenge today is to be minimalist yet deliver the main imagery through powerful representation. With that said our goal was to explore whether a powerful convolutional architecture backed with a traditional machine learning pipeline could be leveraged to learn this morphology along with contextual labels to recommend similar movies that perhaps evoke the same feeling. To that end we have deployed an app on AWS that recommends similar movies based on an uploaded image and learns from live user feed back which metric to use for this recommendation. Similar ideas like this are being explored by ad tech companies like Ad theorent to recommend targeted ad to geospatial groups.Perhaps we could afterall judge a movie by its cover if not a book
